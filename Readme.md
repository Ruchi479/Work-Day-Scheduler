# Week 6 Homework: # Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

#Briefly Description about Project:
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

# Completed Tasks

* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

* User will be presented with timeblocks for standard business hours when user scrolls down.

* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

* WHEN User click into a timeblock THEN User can enter an event

* WHEN User click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

* WHEN User refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
